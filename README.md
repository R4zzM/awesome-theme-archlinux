awesome-theme-archlinux
=======================

This is an Arch Linux theme for awesome-WM. Who initially created it is
unknown. If my memory is  correct, I found it on a "10 themes for Arch Linux
page" or something like that.

However, I have made modifications to it (to the better, of course) and I
have ported it to awesome 3.5+.
